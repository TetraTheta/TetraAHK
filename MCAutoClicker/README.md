# MCAutoClicker

I made it because I felt tired from pressing the mouse for a long time or continuously pressing it while playing Minecraft.  
Currently, the script provides the following functions:

  * <kbd>Mouse4</kbd> : Press and hold the left mouse button until the hotkey is pressed again.<br>
    If the Minecraft window loses focus, script will stop pressing the mouse button.
  * <kbd>Mouse5</kbd> : Click left mouse button every specified time interval.  
    It sends a click signal even if the window is minimized or placed behind another window.
