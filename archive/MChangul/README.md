# MChangul

This script is for Korean Minecraft players who use Korean IME.

If IME is set to Korean, because IME is set to Korean(not English), players is blocked from interacting with game via keyboard like moving or opening inventory.

This script set IME between Korean and English automatically. If player opens chat via <kbd>ENTER</kbd> it press <kbd>한/영</kbd> automatically to switch to Korean input mode, and if player sends chat via pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, it press <kbd>한/영</kbd> again to automatically switch to English input mode.

In recent update in Minecraft, it changed its window title so this script doesn't work now.
